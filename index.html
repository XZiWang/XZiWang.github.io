<h1>Welcome to ZiXiu's Homepage</h1>
<h2> Biography </h2>
I obtained my Master's degree and Bachelor's degree in 2021 and 2018 respectively from USTC, under the supervision of Hu Ding. 
From 2020 to 2021, I worked as an intern at the AI Lab in ByteDance, where I was mentored by Yiwen Guo.

<h2> Research </h2>
<h3> Research Interests </h3>
I am interested in algorithm design and machine learning, encompassing a wide range of topics.
My experience lies in developing algorithms for handling large datasets, as well as working with online and streaming algorithms, robust optimization 
and their applications in machine learning, such as active learning and efficient training computation. 
Additionally, I have a strong inclination towards generative models, Bayesian inference, and leveraging deep models to tackle combinatorial optimization problems.
